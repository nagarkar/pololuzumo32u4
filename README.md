Examples for Pololu Zumo 32u4 robot running QP state machines.

You'll need a robot to run these, of course.

In addition, you'll need to install the QM modeler, and other prereqs (see Blinky Readme.md)

General Troubleshooting tips

Q. What to do when Arduino can't upload
A. What works for me is to press the reset button on the pololu two times quickly when the 'Upload' attempt is being made. 
In the verbose mode, this looks like a lot of lines printing out COM ports (searching for one that works). In Arduino IDE, you'll see the
message 'Uploading' in the header bar.
